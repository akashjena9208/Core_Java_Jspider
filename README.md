# Core_Java_Jspider
Core Java is the basic part of the Java programming language, and is used to create general-purpose applications
Java is a robust language, and there's quite a bit to cover in Core Java! Here's a broad overview of the key topics often included:

### **Basics of Java**
1. **Introduction to Java:** History, features, and versions of Java.
2. **Setting up the Environment:** Installing JDK, setting up PATH, and IDEs.
3. **Basic Syntax:** Java syntax, conventions, and structure of a Java program.
   
### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
1. **Classes and Objects:** Creating classes and objects, fields, methods, and constructors.
2. **Inheritance:** Superclass and subclass, method overriding.
3. **Polymorphism:** Compile-time and runtime polymorphism, method overloading.
4. **Encapsulation:** Data hiding, access modifiers.
5. **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces.

### **Core Concepts**
1. **Data Types and Variables:** Primitive types, reference types, type conversions.
2. **Operators:** Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.
3. **Control Structures:** If-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while).
4. **Arrays:** Single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
5. **Strings:** String class, String methods, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder.

### **Exception Handling**
1. **Exceptions and Errors:** Types of exceptions, try-catch, throw, throws, and finally.
2. **Custom Exceptions:** Creating and handling user-defined exceptions.
  
### **Collections Framework**
1. **List:** ArrayList, LinkedList.
2. **Set:** HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.
3. **Map:** HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap.
4. **Queue:** PriorityQueue, Deque.

### **Input/Output in Java**
1. **File I/O:** Reading and writing files using `File`, `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`.
2. **Streams:** InputStream, OutputStream, Serialization.

### **Multithreading and Concurrency**
1. **Threads:** Creating threads, thread life cycle, and thread synchronization.
2. **Concurrency:** Executors, thread pools, synchronization blocks, locks.

### **Java 8 Features**
1. **Lambda Expressions:** Syntax and use cases.
2. **Streams API:** Functional-style operations on streams of elements.
3. **Functional Interfaces:** Concept and predefined functional interfaces.
4. **Optional Class:** Handling nulls in collections and return values.

### **Miscellaneous Topics**
1. **Java Annotations:** Custom annotations and pre-defined annotations.
2. **Generics:** Type parameters, bounded and unbounded wildcards.
3. **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** Connect to database, execute queries.
4. **JVM and Memory Management:** Java Virtual Machine architecture, garbage collection.

It's a lot to take in, but learning Java can be a really rewarding experience! Where would you like to start?
